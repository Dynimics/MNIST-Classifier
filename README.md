# MNIST-Classifier
This is my first ML/Neural Network Project. It is written in Python 3.7.9 using the PyTorch library. It is a 'beginner' project that uses the [MNIST Dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) to predict hand drawn characters with up to 98% accuracy.

It was created using [this series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDdeMyHEYc0gxFpYwHY2Qfdh) on YouTube
